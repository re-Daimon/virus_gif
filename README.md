# virus_gif
This is an *.hta template, where you need to insert your own value and it will be virus_gif, made with the help of Empire. What's the fun of this thing ? The joke is that you just throw this gif to someone, and you get remote access. Be careful, as antiviruses are burning, so we need to improve it :). In order for everything to work, you need to do everything that I wrote at the bottom. ðŸ˜Ž

- Self Empire: https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire
- I indicated there that it is necessary to change.
- First, you need to convert your gif to base64.
- Second, in the Empire itself, you need to get the base64 code.


If anything, this is not my code, 
I added it here, since the site was blocked, 
and that code can no longer be found, but I still have it, 
so I'll leave it here :)
